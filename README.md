# Interactive-Plots-eQTL-Comparison

The objective of this Python module is to generate interactive plots using Plotly Dash, facilitating visual exploration and comparison of eQTL effect sizes across different cell types and conditions between two different studies. This tool aims to help researchers gain insights into the concordance between the two studies, allowing a deeper understanding of how genetic variations influence gene expression across diverse experimental conditions and cell types.

## Usage
Two datasets that were used in this module are table S8 of "Single-cell RNA-seq reveals cell typeâ€“specific molecular and genetic associations to lupus" (2022) by Perez *et al.* and table s10 of "

```
An example usage of the script is:

    ./app.py
